# Katana Framework

**Katana** is a lightweight, scalable microframework designed to solve common challenges in healthcare IT system integration. Built with a strong focus on **data pipeline orchestration**, **interoperability layer simplification**, and **low-overhead integration logic**, Katana enables healthcare organizations to rapidly connect disparate systems with minimal custom coding effort.

Katana aims to accelerate healthcare digital transformation by providing a solid technical foundation for building, scaling, and maintaining integration services â€” helping institutions meet modern demands for interoperability, compliance, and cost-efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Lightweight Core:** Minimal external dependencies; easily embeddable into existing JVM-based systems.
- **Pipeline-Oriented Architecture:** Define modular, reusable integration flows for healthcare-specific use cases.
- **Interoperability Ready:** Built for EHR data exchange scenarios; supports flexible adapters and schema-mapping strategies.
- **Rule-Driven Transformations:** Easily author and apply transformation and validation rules across incoming and outgoing data streams.
- **Scalable Deployment:** Designed for both embedded service mode and containerized deployment (Docker/Kubernetes ready).
- **Auditability Focus:** Native support for traceable data flows and secure logging practices to meet healthcare compliance standards.

---

## Core Use Cases

- Rapid prototyping of healthcare interoperability microservices (e.g., FHIR resource ingestion, HL7v2-to-FHIR conversion).
- Building lightweight data pipelines for clinical, administrative, and operational healthcare datasets.
- Scaling pilot interoperability projects into production-grade platforms.
- Reducing custom integration overhead by leveraging predefined transformation and routing templates.

---

## Example Applications

- Connecting multiple EHRs within a hospital group under a single patient portal.
- Building audit-compliant transformation layers for sensitive healthcare transaction records.
- Deploying modular ETL pipelines between clinical systems, payers, and national HIE frameworks.

## Installation

Add Katana as a dependency:

```xml
<!-- Maven -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.alisa.katana</groupId>
    <artifactId>katana-core</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

or

```groovy
// Gradle
implementation 'dev.alisa.katana:katana-core:0.1.0'
```

(Repository links for Maven Central or GitHub Packages would go here if public.)

---

## Quick Start Example

```java
IntegrationFlow katanaFlow = Katana.flow()
    .input("FHIR_R4_Bundle")
    .transform(new FhirToInternalModelTransformer())
    .route(new ServiceRouter())
    .output("DownstreamAnalyticsPipeline")
    .build();
```

---

## FHIR Ingestion Service

Katana includes a simple `FhirIngestionService` capable of reading a FHIR Bundle
from a JSON string or file. The service can be triggered through the new `/fhir-
ingest` endpoint.

Example usage:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8082/fhir-ingest?file=resources/bundle.json"
```

When invoked, the service will parse the bundle (using a stubbed parser) and
return a `PatientRecord` representation.
